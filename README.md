#Using JQUERY to make webpages more interactive

#Jquery is a javaScript library that makes it easy for developers to add functionality to a page and make the page lively

#We can do this by using our favourite IDE. I prefere visual studio code. Write a simple HTML5 layout and add the JQUERY link to the head.
Create the jquery function in the head of your DOM and use it inside the body of your program to perform an action.
